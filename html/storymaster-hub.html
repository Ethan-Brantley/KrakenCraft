            <p>There are a few things you probably want to know!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People may call you StoryDaddy. Don't be alarmed. You're doing great!</li>

                <li>Plan <a href="#modules">modules</a> and <a href="#connectors">connectors</a>, but try not to plan so precisely that players lose <a href="https://www.universityxp.com/blog/2020/8/20/what-is-player-agency">agency</a></li>
                <li><a href="#action-card">Action Cards</a> can be a useful tool to inform a player about a specific thing you want them to "remember" or a nudging hint on how you plan to use their character in a coming module.</li>
                <li>Be ready to improvise! No matter how well you plan, some of the best narratives are built through guided improvisation and building off the players' own creativity and decisions.</li>

            <h2>What's your job?</h2>
            <p>As the StoryMaster, you have the power to guide the players' story for everyone's collective enjoyment. It is up to you to plan a story for the players to experience. On this page, you will find tools and suggestions that will hopefully help you do this without needing to dedicate too much time, or without much experience in storytelling!</p>
            <p>Your goal as the StoryMaster is create a shared experience between the players.</p>
            <p>The most important aspects of a good story follow. These are absolutely necessary for a good narrative:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protagonists - the good guys. These are the players.</li>
                <li>The Challenge - </li>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>In the course of the story, the players (and their characters) should be vital to the story. When you are outlining the basics of the story you want to share, keep in mind which characters the players are going to play. How can you include moments for their characters to demonstrate their background, their skills, or their personality? By baking opprotunities for this into your story, you are giving players ample ability to have fun, be creative in their own characters' stories, and feel like their characters matter and are important to the story you're telling.</p>
            <p>For example, if one of your characters is a ___, you could ___.</p>

            <h2>Modules</h2>
            <p>Modules are snapshots, brief encounters, bits of storytelling. They are the suspicious man in the saloon who knows more than he lets on, the crime scene riddled with clues, the cryptic letter left by a close friend. A module is a single story beat, one moment, or setting, or conversation. Planning modules are your main tool in guiding the story and providing structure for the players.</p>
            <img src="#" alt="long image showing a story progression through modules">
            <p>There are two parts to a good module:</p>
            <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>At all times, players should know a) what they are doing and b) why they are doing it</p>
            <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The players should learn <i>something</i> during the course of the module. A new clue to the mystery, a new location they haven't explored, a new danger they were unaware of. There should be some tidbit of information learned during the module that will inform the players' decision on what to do next.</p>
